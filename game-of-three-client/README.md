# Game of Three Client
- React app
- Minimum consideration was given for layout design as it was not a priority
- Player One starts the game first always (assumption)
- Input validations in UI can be improved
- Layout design can be improved
- Tests for the front-end were not written because of the time constraints
- Client should be a separate project but for the purpose of this challenge it's included in the same project
